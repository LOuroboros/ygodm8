## About this document

I'll use it write changes I'd like to make to the game in the future, when ygodm8 progresses as a decompilation project.

## List of changes

* Disable the sweeping animation when the game checks for effects in every phase of a duel.

* Modify certain dialogues to make them more digestible.

  * Isis treating the Player like they're mentally handicapped is rather rude and annoying.

* Introduce a postgame duel against Jaden Yuki from the first episode of YGO GX.

* Add new cards.

  * Every card needed to build Jaden Yuki's first Elemental Hero deck.

  * Heart of the Underdog (YGO WCT 2006), Summoner's Art, Ancient Rules, and King of the Skull Servants (YGO WCT 2006), Sorcerer of Dark Magic and Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon because I like those cards.

* Change the transition from Domino City to the Player's Home or Solomon Muto's Card Shop.

  * By default, it's a transition coupled with a fade out, which is slow.

* Phase out elements altogether and maybe introduce the Guardian Stars from YGO FM in their place.

* Maybe add the iteration of Jaden Yuki from Season 4 to the Hall of Eternity. Idk.

* Stop tracking LPs. Every duel should start at 8000 imo.

* Every duel in the Hall of Eternity should also start at 8000.

* Remove the bullshit from many of the game's decks. People shouldn't get access to 3 copies of Raigeki if the Player can't, period.

* Add duels with Ryou Bakura, as another duelist to duel along the rest of The Yugi Gang.

  * Kinda surprising Konami didn't add him at all, considering him and Yami Bakura were somewhat relevant in RoD's prequel, "The Sacred Cards".

* Make the generic duelists from Domino City rematchable at the beginning of the game in a circuit form.

  * Once you defeat all of them, you'll be able to duel them again.

* Trigger the Ra Phoenix Mode event in Egypt if the Player has a copy of Winged Dragon of Ra (Battle Mode) in their deck, after defeating Simon Muran in China.

* Rename Paradox to either Simon Muran or just Simon.

  * Why THE FUCK is he even called "Paradox" lmao.

* Make cards sell for half of their buying price instead of 5%.

* Increase deck capacity gains.

* Get rid of duelist level. Why is this even a thing.

* Hide any card from the Trunk that the Player doesn't have. Why THE FUCK did they pointlessly bloat the Trunk like that is well beyond me.

* Allow to sell a card or stake it in an ante duel even if it's the last copy in the Player's trunk.

* Add some new passwords to increase the card drops per duel *(1 card, 3 cards and 5 cards max.)*

* Port over the Dark Magician's and the Blue-Eyes White Dragon's designs of the anime from YGO TEDS, because I like them better.

  * I think I'll keep the manga designs for Yugi and Kaiba though.

* Give the Black Luster Soldier to Yami Yugi.

  * Funnily enough, there's a voice line for when Yami uses BLD to attack in the game's files, yet, he's not given that card in any of his decks. Nice one Konami.

* Look into adding a language selection to make use of the translated text strings the game has, and **[fill in in the blanks](https://tcrf.net/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Reshef_of_Destruction#Unused_Translations)** such as location names.

  * At least for the Spanish language.

* Don't let effects such as Hourglass of Life's, which require you to pay LP, to be used if you don't have enough LP.

* Allow monster effects such as Hourglass of Life's to be activated even if they're face up on the field.

  * No reason why they shouldn't be able to.

* Replace the rectangle character that acts as the end of line text character with a down arrow instead.

* While checking a card's details, allow to move from one card to another in the field using the L/R buttons.

* Put the "Use as Ante" option before the "Details" one.
